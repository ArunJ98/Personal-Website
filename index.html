                <p> I partake in a program called FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition). FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Techonolgy) is a non profit organization which hosts this wonderful competition every year. The video on the left is our team (4048) playing this years game. I am operating the robot! </p>

                <p>This year was my 4th year in this program and I have loved every second of it. The real-world scenerio with time limitations and other limitations really captivate me and I love trying to design a new robot each year for the challenge presented to us. The first two years, I was a middle schooler and thus I spent those two years learning as much as I could from the mentors and the high schoolers. Last year, I started taking a bigger role on the robot as I continued developing my skills to lead the team once the seniors left. This year, I was the Associate Director of Electrical which meant that I was co-leading the electrical team. I also led a sub-team of the Mechanical team to build our claw mechanicsm which picks up the totes. Overall, I love this program and I have learned <em> SO MUCH </em> in my time with this program and I hope I can continue to do so the next few years. </p>
